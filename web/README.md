# Winnies javascript desktop

So far this project is no more than a proof of concept.
(Full of bugs, half written modules etc.)

It is running entirely in the browser.
At boot time a small component 'Browser Virtual File System' is loadad,
wich loads fully configurable 'installables'.

A demo can be found at <a href="http://winnies2.livep2000.nl" target="_blank">Winnies live demo</a>
